    "### An intro about statistics terminologies:\n",
    "#### Mean/Average:\n",
    "The mean is the average of the numbers.\n",
    "It is easy to calculate: add up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: 6, 11, 7  \n",
    "Add the numbers: 6 + 11 + 7 = 24  \n",
    "Divide by how many numbers (there are 3 numbers): 24 / 3 = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Median:\n",
    "The Median is the \"middle\" of a sorted list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: Median of 12, 3 and 5 (odd count)  \n",
    "Put them in order:\n",
    "3, 5, 12  \n",
    "The middle is 5, so the median is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "12 3 5 6  \n",
    "3 4 6 12  \n",
    "4+6 =10/2=5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode:\n",
    "The mode is simply the number which appears most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example {6, 3, 9, 6, 6, 5, 9, 3}   \n",
    "the Mode is 6, as it occurs most often.\n",
    "We can have more than one mode.  \n",
    "\n",
    "{1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 9}  \n",
    "3 appears three times, as does 6.\n",
    "So there are two modes: at 3 and 6  \n",
    "Having two modes is called \"bimodal\".\n",
    "Having more than two modes is called \"multimodal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Deviation\n",
    "The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are.\n",
    "Its symbol is σ (the greek letter sigma)  \n",
    "The formula is the square root of the Variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "σ  = √ Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance\n",
    "The average of the squared differences from the Mean.\n",
    "Variance is calculated to see how far the values are from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the variance follow these steps:  \n",
    "Sort the values and find Mean  (the simple average of the numbers)\n",
    "Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the numbers (the squared difference).\n",
    "Then work out the average of those squared differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: 10,14,13,12  \n",
    "After Sorting: 10,12,13,14  \n",
    "Mean=(10+12+13+14)/4=12(12.25 rounded off)  \n",
    "Variance=((12-10)^2+(12-12)^2+(12-13)^2+(12-14)^2)/4=(4+0+1+4)/4=2.25  \n",
    "Standard Deviation= √ 2= 1.5  "
